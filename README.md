Lamp operation experiment
#### We worked on the relay, ESP, Arduino board, and LED, and then programmed them to turn on the lamp by giving a command to start and stop using voice.
##### "First, we connected the ground (GND) of the relay to the ground (GND) of the Arduino, and we connected the voltage (VCC) to a 5V power source. Then, we connected the signal wire (SIG) from the relay to pin number 2 on the ESP. We also connected the ground (GND) from the Arduino to the ESP to complete the circuit. Additionally, we powered the Arduino with a battery and connected the ESP to the device. We also connected the wires for the lamp to the electricity
